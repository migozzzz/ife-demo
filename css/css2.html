        Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having
        little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
        shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
        the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating
        the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
        whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find
        myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
        the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get
        such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
        prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
        knocking people's hats off- then, I account it high time to get to sea
        as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
        philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
        take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew
        it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
        nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

        There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
        wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her
        surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
        downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
        cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
        Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
